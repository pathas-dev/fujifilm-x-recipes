# Guide

## Purpose of this website
> This is a website created to allow users to conveniently search and view various recipes using a [recipe database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11PvZ7rOnwmbz5VylVIvzOuWwEa83c0DweAlBwJ2pZJc/edit#gid=1775432829) organized by [Henri-Pierre Chavaz](https://hpchavaz-photography.blogspot.com/) and to manage personal recipes as notes.

## Note
- 1. Local Data  
Because the database is not linked and the browser's local storage is used, data saved in 'bookmark' or 'custom' pages are not shared between browsers.
- 2. Responsive Design
Responsive design allows you to use it optimally on PC and mobile devices.
- 3. PWA  
The Progressive Web App function is applied, so you can install it from the website and use it like an app on your PC or mobile device.

## Page guide

### Bookmarks page
This is a page where you can collect cards by clicking the icon at the top right of the recipe card on the 'Recipes' page.  
You can unbookmark by clicking the icon in the upper right corner of the card, and click again before leaving the page to bookmark again. 
You can collect and view cards using the filter (film, camera, sensor buttons), sort (4th button), and black and white toggle buttons at the top of the page.
**This filter function can also be used in the same way on the 'Recipes' and 'Custom' pages.**

### Recipes page
This is a page where you can search recipes organized in the database in card form.  
The recipe data itself is not requested from the server, but
Because image files are loaded for each card, if your plan does not have enough data, we recommend sorting first and then scrolling down.
You can view it on the ‘Bookmarks’ page by clicking the bookmark icon at the top right of the recipe card.
Click on the camera name to view detailed settings.

### Custom page
This is a page where you can write down your own recipe settings.  
After entering the recipe name, camera, and base film, you can adjust the settings by scrolling left and right through the menus below.
After adjusting the settings, click the '+ Document' icon in the upper right corner to save the recipe data to local storage.
When you click the 'Mail' icon, you can enter your email address and receive the currently saved recipes as a JSON file.
You can load recipes sent by email by clicking the 'arrow' icon and registering the JSON file.
