# 📖 Guide

## 🌐 Purpose of this website
> This is a website created to allow users to conveniently search and view various recipes using a [recipe database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11PvZ7rOnwmbz5VylVIvzOuWwEa83c0DweAlBwJ2pZJc/edit#gid=1775432829) organized by [Henri-Pierre Chavaz](https://hpchavaz-photography.blogspot.com/) and to manage personal recipes as notes.

## ⚠️ Note

- 2. Responsive Design
Responsive design allows you to use it optimally on PC and mobile devices.
- 3. PWA  
The Progressive Web App function is applied, so you can install it from the website and use it like an app on your PC or mobile device.
